# Proxy Deployment Overview

## Overview

We have used hardhat deploy and a proxy type of EIP173 (the default hardhat proxy). 
There are two deployment scripts
* 001_deploy_miniWallet.ts: Does initial Deployof the MiniWallet Proxy and Implementation.
* 002_upgrade_miniWallet.ts: Deploys a new implementation contract and updates the MiniWallet Proxy to point to the new implementation.

See [Sample Deployments](#sample-deployments) below

**Notes**
1. Contract addresses for each chain are held in the deployments folder ` "address": "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512",`
2. Upgrade logic reads these addresses 
3. When testing upgrades locally you need to set `ethLocal` to `` in `hardhat.config.ts`
```
    ethLocal: {
      url: process.env.ETH_LOCAL_URL,
      gasPrice: 20000000000,
      gas: 6000000,
      live: false,
      saveDeployments: true,
      tags: ['local']
    },
``` 

## Deployments

`yarn deploy --network ethLocal` : Does initial Deployof the MiniWallet Proxy and Implementation.

`yarn deploy-upgrade --network ethLocal` : Deploys a new implementation contract and updates the MiniWallet Proxy to point to the new implementation.


## Improvements

### Improve transparency and readabilty
A cleaner solution was proposed in [Pull Request #12](https://github.com/polymorpher/sms-wallet/pull/12#pullrequestreview-1095436440)
For each chain, we only need three things: proxy contract, deployed proxy address, and logic contract address. Rather than keeping a bunch of JSON files and irrelevant information in those files, I think it is better to just store these three pieces of information in a file inside a folder (similar to relayer/cache, but can be simpler, e.g. the versions can be hash of contracts instead). When we need to upgrade the contract later, we just read from that file and call relevant functions accordingly (i.e. (1) deploy a new logic contract, (2) redirect proxy to the address of the new logic contract). I have read https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#deploying-and-upgrading-proxies and examined underlying types (ProxyOptionsBase, etc.) but I am not sure whether hardhat-deploy library supports manual selection (of logic contract address) during upgrade. It would be nice if it does, but even if it doesn't, it seems not hard to just implement on our own - should be just a few lines.

**Decisions**
* To enable greater control of the deployment process we have implemented our own Proxy which is a copy of Open Zeppelins `ERC1967.sol`.
* We chose to use the `ERC1967.sol` as the proxy because it enabled compliance with Open Zeppelin Token Contracts.
* We populated the `ADMIN_SLOT` to enable the use of hardhat-deploy with Open Zepplin UUPS Proxy [see here](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/issues/146#issuecomment-1244642086).

**We have implemented the following**
1. Implemented our own UUPS Compliant Proxy [ERC1967.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Proxy.sol).
2. Updated MiniWallet and MiniId to populate `ADMIN_SLOT` for [hardhat-deploy compatability](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/issues/146#issuecomment-1244642086)
2. Update the Deployment scripts to use this proxy ` proxyContract: 'ERC1967',`
3. Update the upgrade script to call MiniWallet Deploy and MiniWalletProxy.upgradeTo explicitly.
4. Tested Upgrades of both MiniWallet and MiniID in `miniwallet/deploy/999_test.ts`

**Still to be implemented**
1. Use [deterministicDeployment](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#deploymentsdeployname-options) `  deterministicDeployment? boolean | string; // if true, it will deploy the contract at a deterministic address based on bytecode and constructor arguments. The address will be the same across all network. It use create2 opcode for that, if it is a string, the string will be used as the salt.`
2. Test using different deployers (can do this by changing mnemonic when starting chain locally)
3. If desired create our our Deployment Factory using a `create3` opcode based deterministic deploy.
4. Capture the MiniWalletProxy and MiniWallet Logic contract deployed addresses in the Deployment Scripts and persist them under a separate folder (e.g. `cache`).
5. Make Mini721 and Mini1155 upgradeable (using a UUPS proxy)

**Note: [OpenZepplin UUPS Hardhat Deploy Support Issue](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/issues/146)**

### Improve Modularity (NFT Identity)
As we develop NFT Identity we may want to have the MiniWallet Proxy point to multiple (MiniWallet and Mini721 and Mini1155) contracts (facets). We can support this using [EIP-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) as implemented in [Hardhat Deploy: Built-In Support for Diamonds](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#builtin-in-support-for-diamonds-eip2535.) 


### NFT Factory Support
If we decide we want to provide the ability for Creators to deploy their own contract we can implement this using the [Clones Proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Clones)
