  @title An asset management contract for low value tokens and assets.
  @author John Whitton https://github.com/johnwhitton/
  @notice This contract allows users to transfer native tokens and authorize recipients
  (such as games) to receive these tokens. Once approved it can transfer the native tokens on behalf of the user.
  It also can transfer ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens on behalf of the user, after the user approves the MiniWallet contract to do so.
  @dev The MiniWallet is designed to simplify management and transfer of tokens
  by light clients such as the sms-wallet.
